# EEG_Band_and_Frequency_Filter_GUI_app

The program allows the user to easily perform tasks related to frequency band filters (such as alpha, beta, etc.) and custom frequency filtering (e.g., low-pass, high-pass) of EEG signals in the form of a '.txt' file.  
The code "run_app.py" automatically starts downloading the necessary packages after execution, and then the "EEG_Task_NeuroChallenge.py" code runs. Therefore, an internet connection is required during the first run.


To run the program, simply execute the "run_app.py" file. After it runs and the user interface is ready, you can use the two sample brain signal data files, "Data A.txt" and "Data B.txt", to work with.
