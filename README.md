# EEG Band and Frequency Filter GUI app

The program allows the user to easily perform tasks related to frequency band filters (such as alpha, beta, etc.) and custom frequency filtering (e.g., low-pass, high-pass) of EEG signals in the form of a '.txt' file.  
The code "run_app.py" automatically starts downloading the necessary packages after execution, and then the "EEG_Task_NeuroChallenge.py" code runs. Therefore, an internet connection is required during the first run.


To run the program, simply execute the "run_app.py" file. After it runs and the user interface is ready, you can use the two sample brain signal data files, "Data A.txt" and "Data B.txt", to work with.
